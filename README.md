# DayZRaidCalculator
A Raid Calculator For DayZ

## Accuracy
This calculator is meant to give you the rough idea of how many supplies you need to bring to a raid. You may notice differences depending on many factors including:
- The gun you use
- The range from which you are shooting
- The amount of shots missed
- And many more factors

The stats you will see on this site are tested from point blank range. For those interested, the guns used to test this are the DMR, Bizon, UMP45, Ak74, AKM, VSD, Vikhir, Vaiga, and MP5. These weapons were chosen as they have the highest magazine capacity for each ammo type.

## Roadmap
- Verify each method
- Save amount fields to a browser cookie (Not sure if I can do this on github pages, may need to migrate project to another host for this)
- Settings option for different backgrounds

## Suggestions
If you have any suggestions for this tool, I am very open to feedback. Whether it is a visual criticism or a functional request - I would love to hear about it.
Please open an issue (or comment on an existing one)!

## Current Statistics WIP
Currently, not all of the ammo types have been tested, most stats were scraped from the corners of the internet, including:
- [JournalistTop1482](https://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/1aggae5/updated_raid_chart_vanilla/)
- [Asmodian](https://www.reddit.com/r/dayz/comments/hkvc65/walls_damage_chart/)

However, there is an ongoing effort to verify the statistics for the current version of the game, as most of the posts are years old. The currently verified items are the:
Claymore, Grenade, Plastic Explosive, Landmine

If you are interested in testing any of these on your own, please open an 'issue' with the weapon you used and the amount of bullets for each object at point blank range.
